# 🔧 Firebase App Check Fix

## 🚨 **Problem**
iOS app getting App Check failures:
```
App attestation failed.
AppCheck failed: The operation couldn't be completed.
HTTP status code: 403
```

## ✅ **Solution: Disable App Check for Development**

### **Step 1: Go to Firebase Console**
1. Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `boxfort-6a746`
3. Go to **App Check** in the left sidebar

### **Step 2: Configure App Check**
1. **Find your iOS app** in the list
2. Click **Manage** or **Configure**
3. **Disable App Check** for development:
   - Set **Enforcement** to **Unenforced**
   - Or **Disable** App Check entirely

### **Step 3: Alternative - Add Debug Token**
If you want to keep App Check enabled:

1. **Generate Debug Token:**
   ```swift
   // Add this to your iOS app
   AppCheck.setAppCheckProviderFactory(AppCheckDebugProviderFactory())
   ```

2. **Add Debug Token to Firebase Console:**
   - Go to App Check → iOS app
   - Add the debug token
   - Set enforcement to **Unenforced** for debug tokens

## 🚀 **Quick Fix: Disable App Check**

**For immediate testing, disable App Check:**

1. **Firebase Console** → **App Check**
2. **Select your iOS app**
3. **Set Enforcement to "Unenforced"**
4. **Save changes**

## 🔍 **What This Fixes**

- ✅ **Reading progress** - can save to Firestore
- ✅ **User data** - can read/write user documents
- ✅ **Reading sessions** - co-reading works
- ✅ **All Firestore operations** - no more permission errors

## 🎯 **Testing**

After disabling App Check:

1. **Restart iOS app** completely
2. **Try reading a book** - should save progress
3. **Check console** - no more App Check errors
4. **Read Together should work** (uses Realtime Database, not Firestore)

## 💡 **Note**

**App Check is a security feature** that validates your app is legitimate. For development/testing, it's safe to disable. For production, you'll want to properly configure it.

**The Read Together feature uses Firebase Realtime Database, so it should work regardless of App Check issues!**

## 🚨 **If Still Having Issues**

If disabling App Check doesn't work, the issue might be:

1. **Firestore Security Rules** - too restrictive
2. **Authentication** - user not properly signed in
3. **Network** - connectivity issues

**Check the Firestore rules in `FIREBASE_FIRESTORE_FIX.md` as well!**
