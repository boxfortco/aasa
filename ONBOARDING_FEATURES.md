# Onboarding and Prominent Free Books Features

## Overview

This implementation adds two key features to improve user engagement and conversion:

1. **First-Time User Onboarding Carousel** - A full-screen carousel for new users to choose their first book
2. **Prominent Free Books Carousel** - A prominent carousel for users who haven't completed any books yet

## Features

### 1. Onboarding Carousel (`OnboardingCarouselView`)

- **Purpose**: Introduces new users to the app and guides them to their first book
- **Design**: Full-screen carousel similar to Pokemon TCG Pocket app
- **Functionality**:
  - Swipeable carousel of free books
  - 3D depth effect with scaling and opacity
  - Tap to select and start reading
  - Skip option for users who want to explore later
- **Trigger**: Shows on first app launch (before any book completion)

### 2. Prominent Free Books Carousel (`ProminentFreeBooksCarousel`)

- **Purpose**: Prominently displays free books for users who haven't completed any books
- **Design**: Horizontal carousel with enhanced visual appeal
- **Functionality**:
  - Shows above all other content
  - "FREE" badges on book covers
  - Page indicators
  - Prominent "Read Now" buttons
- **Trigger**: Shows when user hasn't completed any books (based on `book_reading_completed` Firebase events)

### 3. Book Completion Tracking (`BookCompletionService`)

- **Purpose**: Tracks which books users have completed
- **Data Source**: Firebase `reading_progress` collection with `completed: true`
- **Integration**: Automatically updates when books are completed in `BookView`
- **State Management**: Observable object that updates UI based on completion status

## Implementation Details

### Key Files

1. **`OnboardingCarouselView.swift`** - Full-screen onboarding experience
2. **`ProminentFreeBooksCarousel.swift`** - Prominent free books display
3. **`BookCompletionService.swift`** - Book completion tracking service
4. **`HomePage.swift`** - Integration of both features
5. **`BookView.swift`** - Integration with completion tracking

### User Flow

1. **First Launch**: User sees onboarding carousel
2. **No Books Completed**: User sees prominent free books carousel above all content
3. **After First Book Completion**: Prominent carousel disappears, normal free books section shows
4. **Subscribed Users**: Paywall section shows instead of free books

### Firebase Integration

- Uses existing `reading_progress` collection
- Tracks `book_reading_completed` events
- Stores completion status with user and child IDs
- Real-time updates when books are completed

### Analytics

- `onboarding_carousel_shown` - When onboarding is displayed
- `prominent_free_books_shown` - When prominent carousel is displayed
- Existing `book_reading_completed` events continue to work

## Configuration

### UserDefaults Keys

- `hasCompletedOnboarding` - Tracks if user has seen onboarding
- `hasShownSubscriptionConfetti` - Existing key for subscription confetti

### Customization

- Free books are sourced from `BookSection.freeBooks`
- Visual styling uses existing design system
- Fonts: `LondrinaSolid-Regular` and `LondrinaSolid-Light`
- Colors: Existing `ColorConstants` and gradients

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **New User**: Should see onboarding carousel
2. **User with No Completed Books**: Should see prominent free books carousel
3. **User with Completed Books**: Should see normal free books section
4. **Subscribed User**: Should see paywall section
5. **Book Completion**: Should update completion status and hide prominent carousel

### Reset for Testing

To test onboarding again:
```swift
UserDefaults.standard.removeObject(forKey: "hasCompletedOnboarding")
```

To test prominent carousel:
```swift
// Clear completion status in BookCompletionService
completionService.hasCompletedAnyBook = false
completionService.completedBooks = []
```
